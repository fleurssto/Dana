# Dana
Dana is a little code that converts .jpeg images in ascii art.

# How it works ?
Dana works with the module Pillow, in Python.

# How to use ?
You can use Dana by instaling Pillow (put pip install pillow), and by running main.py. You have to put your image in .jpeg in the same folder as main.py.

You also have to change the line 6 `with Image.open("lacaz.jpg") as image:` (the ("lacaz.jpg")) by the name of the image.

  *If it's the dana.jpg image, you have to change the line by with `Image.open("dana.jpg")`.*
